# To-Do List for Endpoint Security in Remix App

## 1. User Authentication Endpoints

- [ ] **Implement Registration Endpoint**  
  - **Endpoint:** `POST /users/register`  
  - Ensure new users can register.
  - Validate input (e.g., email format, password strength).
  - Hash passwords before storing them in the database.

- [ ] **Implement Login Endpoint**  
  - **Endpoint:** `POST /users/login`  
  - Validate user credentials.
  - Generate and return a JWT token upon successful login.
  - Handle errors (e.g., invalid credentials, locked account).

- [ ] **Set Up JWT Generation and Secret Key**  
  - Generate JWT tokens using a secret key (`process.env.JWT_SECRET`).
  - Store the secret key securely in environment variables.

## 2. Protect User Data Endpoints

- [ ] **Protect User Profile Endpoint**  
  - **Endpoint:** `GET /users/:id`  
  - Verify JWT token using `verifyToken` utility.
  - Ensure users can only access their profile.
  - Handle unauthorized access by returning a 401 status or redirecting to `/login`.

- [ ] **Protect User Profile Update Endpoint**  
  - **Endpoint:** `PUT /users/:id`  
  - Verify JWT token.
  - Ensure only the authenticated user can update their profile.
  - Validate input and handle unauthorized access.

## 3. Protect Exercise Endpoints

- [ ] **Protect Exercise Retrieval Endpoint**  
  - **Endpoint:** `GET /exercises`  
  - Determine if the endpoint needs to be public or require authentication.
  - If protected, verify JWT and filter data based on user permissions.

- [ ] **Protect Exercise Management Endpoints**  
  - **Endpoint:** `POST /exercises`, `PUT /exercises/:id`, `DELETE /exercises/:id`  
  - Verify JWT token.
  - Ensure only authorized users (e.g., admin or specific roles) can create, update, or delete exercises.
  - Handle unauthorized access.

## 4. Protect Workout Endpoints

- [ ] **Protect Workout Retrieval Endpoint**  
  - **Endpoint:** `GET /workouts`  
  - Verify JWT token.
  - Return only workouts belonging to the authenticated user.

- [ ] **Protect Workout Management Endpoints**  
  - **Endpoint:** `POST /workouts`, `PUT /workouts/:id`, `DELETE /workouts/:id`  
  - Verify JWT token.
  - Ensure users can only manage their own workouts.
  - Validate input and handle unauthorized access.

## 5. Protect Program Endpoints

- [ ] **Protect Program Retrieval Endpoint**  
  - **Endpoint:** `GET /programs`  
  - Verify JWT token.
  - Return programs based on the user's access level (e.g., public programs or user-owned).

- [ ] **Protect Program Management Endpoints**  
  - **Endpoint:** `POST /programs`, `PUT /programs/:id`, `DELETE /programs/:id`  
  - Verify JWT token.
  - Ensure users can only manage their own programs.
  - Validate input and handle unauthorized access.

## 6. Protect Set Endpoints

- [ ] **Protect Set Retrieval and Management Endpoints**  
  - **Endpoint:** `GET /sets`, `GET /sets/:id`, `POST /sets`, `PUT /sets/:id`, `DELETE /sets/:id`  
  - Verify JWT token.
  - Ensure users can only access and modify sets that belong to them.
  - Validate input and handle unauthorized access.

## 7. Protect Schedule Endpoints

- [ ] **Protect Schedule Management Endpoint**  
  - **Endpoint:** `GET /schedules/:programId`, `PUT /schedules/:programId`  
  - Verify JWT token.
  - Ensure only the program owner can access or update the schedule.
  - Handle unauthorized access.

## 8. Protect Cardio Recommendations Endpoints

- [ ] **Protect Cardio Recommendation Endpoints**  
  - **Endpoint:** `GET /programs/:id/cardio`, `POST /programs/:id/cardio`, `PUT /programs/:id/cardio`  
  - Verify JWT token.
  - Ensure only the program owner can access or modify cardio recommendations.
  - Handle unauthorized access.

## 9. Protect Progression Strategy Endpoints

- [ ] **Protect Progression Strategy Endpoints**  
  - **Endpoint:** `GET /programs/:id/progression-strategy`, `POST /programs/:id/progression-strategy`, `PUT /programs/:id/progression-strategy`  
  - Verify JWT token.
  - Ensure only the program owner can access or modify progression strategies.
  - Handle unauthorized access.

## 10. General Security Enhancements

- [ ] **Implement Global Error Handling**  
  - Create a consistent error-handling mechanism for unauthorized access, input validation errors, etc.

- [ ] **Set Up Rate Limiting and Throttling**  
  - Protect all sensitive endpoints from abuse by setting rate limits and throttling.

- [ ] **Ensure Secure Headers and CORS Configuration**  
  - Configure secure headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, XSS Protection).
  - Set up proper CORS rules to allow only trusted origins.

- [ ] **Implement Logging and Monitoring**  
  - Log all authentication attempts, failed access, and unusual activities.
  - Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
